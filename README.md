# Employee-Management_1
Employee Management System is a web-based application designed to manage employee data efficiently. This project utilizes Spring MVC for building the web application framework and Spring JDBC for interacting with the database. The system allows performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employee records, providing a user-friendly interface for administrators to manage employee information.

Technologies Used:

Spring MVC: For building the web application framework and handling web requests.
Spring JDBC: To interact with the database using JDBC templates, simplifying database operations.
Java: Core programming language for backend logic implementation.
Bootstrap: Frontend framework for user interface and interaction.
MySQL: Database management system to store employee data.

Project Structure:

Controller Layer: Handles incoming HTTP requests, processes them, and returns an appropriate response. Responsible for mapping URLs to specific functionalities.
Service Layer: Contains business logic, performs validation, and coordinates data retrieval and manipulation.
DAO (Data Access Object) Layer: Interacts with the database to perform CRUD operations. Utilizes Spring JDBC templates for database access.
Model: Represents the data entities used within the application, such as Employee.
Views: Contains HTML/JSP files responsible for rendering the user interface.
